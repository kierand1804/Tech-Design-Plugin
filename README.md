Teleporter and Drop table UE5
With the Drop table plugin you will need to apply the actor component to an actor you want to drop loot and give the owning actor a GiveLoot function to call (for example when the enemy dies). You will need to go into the data table in the editable folder and add more rows that have items of your own creation, you could also add blank rows to change the weight. In future iterations of this plug in I might have the option of a set % weight.

With the teleporter you can just put it down and move the arrow attached to where you want the player or an object to teleport to.
